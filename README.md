Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm widely 
used for securing sensitive data. It's an enhancement of the original DES algorithm, 
which encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. Triple DES applies DES three 
times, employing two or three distinct keys for each encryption and decryption operation.
